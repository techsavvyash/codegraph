üêõ Identified Issues & Limitations

  1. Vector Search - No Embeddings Populated

  Status: Known limitation, not implemented yet
  - Issue: Vector indexes exist but no nodes have embeddings populated
  - Impact: Vector search always returns 0 results (40% of hybrid search weight unused)
  - Evidence: All search results show "Vector Results: 0"
  - Fix Needed: Implement embedding generation and population for existing nodes

  2. Embedding Service - Mock Implementation Only

  Status: Placeholder implementation
  - Issue: SimpleEmbeddingService.GenerateBatchEmbeddings() always returns mock embeddings (line 74 in
  embedding_service.go)
  - Impact: Even if we call embedding generation, it creates deterministic mock vectors
  - Evidence: Comment says "For now, return mock embeddings"
  - Fix Needed: Implement actual API calls to embedding services (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)

  3. Search Result Display Truncation

  Status: Minor UI issue
  - Issue: Long descriptions/content get truncated to 100 characters with "..."
  - Impact: Users can't see full context in search results
  - Evidence: Lines 888-897 in main.go: description[:97] + "..."
  - Fix Needed: Implement expandable results or better truncation logic

  4. Index Info Display - Limited Information

  Status: Functional but incomplete
  - Issue: Search info only shows basic index status, not detailed metrics
  - Impact: Can't see index size, population percentage, or performance metrics
  - Evidence: Only shows "ONLINE" status, not the rich data available in SHOW INDEXES
  - Fix Needed: Parse and display more comprehensive index information

  5. Error Handling - Incomplete Coverage

  Status: Potential reliability issue
  - Issue: Some operations continue even when components fail
  - Examples:
    - Hybrid search continues even if vector search fails completely
    - Index creation warnings don't prevent initialization "success"
  - Impact: Silent degradation of search quality
  - Fix Needed: Implement proper error aggregation and user feedback

  6. Memory Usage - No Embedding Storage Optimization

  Status: Future scalability concern
  - Issue: Will store 384 float64 values per node when embeddings are populated
  - Impact: ~3KB per node for embeddings alone (1000 nodes = ~3MB)
  - Calculation: 384 dimensions √ó 8 bytes √ó 1000 nodes = ~3MB just for embeddings
  - Fix Needed: Consider compression or dimension reduction strategies

  7. Search Relevance Scoring - Hardcoded Thresholds

  Status: Suboptimal but functional
  - Issue: Relevance categories use fixed thresholds that may not suit all content types
  - Examples:
    - Vector: >0.8 = "high" (lines 316-321 in hybrid_search.go)
    - Full-text: >5.0 = "high" (lines 323-327)
  - Impact: May misclassify relevance for different types of queries
  - Fix Needed: Implement adaptive or configurable thresholds

  8. Neo4j Transaction Memory - Still a Risk

  Status: Mitigated but not eliminated
  - Issue: Batch embedding updates could still hit the 1.4GB transaction limit
  - Impact: If we update embeddings for >400K nodes at once, it could fail
  - Evidence: We know from previous benchmarking that large transactions fail
  - Fix Needed: Implement chunked embedding updates

  9. Search Query Parsing - Basic Implementation

  Status: Limited functionality
  - Issue: No support for advanced query syntax (quotes, operators, field-specific search)
  - Examples: Can't search for exact phrases or exclude terms
  - Impact: Users can't leverage full Lucene query capabilities that Neo4j supports
  - Fix Needed: Implement query parsing and validation

  10. Index Maintenance - No Monitoring

  Status: Operational gap
  - Issue: No health checks or maintenance routines for search indexes
  - Impact: Index corruption or performance degradation won't be detected
  - Evidence: No commands to rebuild, optimize, or monitor index health
  - Fix Needed: Implement index maintenance and monitoring commands

  üîß Priority Levels

  üî• High Priority (Breaks Core Functionality):
  - #1: Vector search embeddings population
  - #2: Real embedding service implementation

  ‚ö° Medium Priority (Affects User Experience):
  - #7: Search relevance scoring improvements
  - #9: Advanced query parsing support

  üí° Low Priority (Future Enhancements):
  - #3: Better result display
  - #6: Memory optimization
  - #10: Index monitoring

  üîç Monitoring Required:
  - #5: Error handling improvements
  - #8: Transaction memory management

  The good news is that our core hybrid search architecture is solid and working correctly. The main gap is that we're
  only utilizing 60% of our search capability (BM25 + semantic) because the vector component needs embeddings to be
  populated.
