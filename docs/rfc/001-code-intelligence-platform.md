# RFC 001: Neo4j-Based Code Intelligence Platform

**Author:** Code Graph Team  
**Date:** 2025-09-13  
**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** 1.0

## Summary

This RFC proposes the implementation of a comprehensive code intelligence platform using Neo4j as the backend graph database. The platform will create a Code Property Graph (CPG) that captures not only syntactic structure but also semantic relationships, control flow, data flow, and connections to business requirements from documents.

## Background

Modern software development, especially in microservices architectures, suffers from fragmented knowledge. Developers need to understand:
- How code components relate to each other across services
- The impact of changes on the broader system
- The connection between business requirements and implementation
- Data flow and control flow through complex systems

Traditional code analysis tools provide limited context, focusing primarily on syntactic structure rather than semantic relationships and cross-service dependencies.

## Motivation

Based on research into Code Property Graphs and their application to code intelligence, we aim to build a platform that:

1. **Provides Deep Context**: Move beyond simple text search to semantic understanding
2. **Enables Cross-Service Analysis**: Unify microservice codebases into a single queryable graph
3. **Connects Business to Code**: Link high-level requirements to concrete implementations
4. **Supports Real-Time Updates**: Provide near-instantaneous updates during development
5. **Scales to Large Codebases**: Handle millions of lines of code efficiently

## Detailed Design

### Architecture Overview

The platform consists of three main components:

1. **Graph Database Layer (Neo4j)**: Stores the unified Code Property Graph
2. **Indexing Pipelines**: Populate and maintain the graph
3. **Query Layer**: Provides APIs for code intelligence queries

### Graph Schema

The core schema extends traditional AST representations with semantic relationships:

#### Node Types
- **Service**: Top-level microservice container
- **File**: Source code files
- **Module/Package**: Logical code groupings
- **Class/Interface**: Object-oriented constructs
- **Function/Method**: Executable code units
- **Variable/Parameter**: Data containers
- **Symbol**: Canonical definitions using SCIP format
- **APIRoute**: Network endpoints
- **Document**: Business/technical documents
- **Feature**: Extractable requirements/capabilities

#### Relationship Types
- **CONTAINS**: Structural hierarchy (AST-like)
- **CALLS**: Function/method invocations
- **DEFINES/REFERENCES**: Symbol definitions and usages
- **INHERITS_FROM/IMPLEMENTS**: OOP relationships
- **FLOWS_TO**: Data dependencies
- **NEXT_EXECUTION**: Control flow
- **EXPOSES_API**: API endpoint handlers
- **DESCRIBES/MENTIONS**: Document-code connections

### Indexing Pipelines

#### 1. Static Indexing Pipeline
- Uses SCIP (Source Code Intelligence Protocol) indexers
- Batch processes stable services
- Generates comprehensive baseline index
- Optimized for accuracy over speed

#### 2. Incremental Indexing Pipeline
- Uses tree-sitter for real-time parsing
- Performs AST diffing for minimal updates
- Optimized for speed over completeness
- Provides IDE-like responsiveness

#### 3. Document Indexing Pipeline
- Processes unstructured documents (PRDs, specs, etc.)
- Extracts features and requirements
- Links business intent to code implementation
- Uses pattern matching and optional LLM assistance

### Query Patterns

#### LSP-Like Queries
- Go to Definition
- Find All References
- Find Implementations
- Symbol completion

#### Advanced Queries
- Impact Analysis: "What APIs are affected by this change?"
- Data Lineage: "How does this parameter flow through the system?"
- Dependency Discovery: "What external services does this service call?"
- Feature Traceability: "What code implements this business requirement?"

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Set up Neo4j infrastructure
- [ ] Define core Go data models
- [ ] Implement basic Neo4j client
- [ ] Create schema management

### Phase 2: Static Indexing (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Build Go AST parser
- [ ] Implement batch loading to Neo4j
- [ ] Create basic query patterns
- [ ] Test with this project as dogfooding

### Phase 3: CLI & API (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Build CLI application
- [ ] Implement query API
- [ ] Add LSP-like query support
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Incremental indexing with tree-sitter
- [ ] Document processing pipeline
- [ ] Advanced query patterns
- [ ] Cross-service analysis

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Use batched operations (UNWIND + MERGE) for Neo4j writes
- Implement query result caching
- Index critical node properties
- Monitor query performance and optimize

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling through read replicas
- Partition large codebases by service
- Implement incremental updates to minimize full reindexing
- Use streaming for large result sets

### Reliability
- Atomic updates within transactions
- Idempotent operations using MERGE
- Health checks and monitoring
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional AST-only approach**: Rejected due to limited semantic understanding
2. **SQL-based graph storage**: Rejected due to poor graph query performance
3. **In-memory graph**: Rejected due to persistence and scaling requirements
4. **Other graph databases (Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB)**: Neo4j chosen for Cypher query language and community support

## Success Metrics

1. **Query Performance**: Sub-100ms response times for LSP queries
2. **Index Completeness**: 99%+ symbol resolution accuracy
3. **Real-time Updates**: <1 second latency for incremental updates
4. **Developer Adoption**: Measurable improvement in code navigation efficiency
5. **System Coverage**: Support for multiple programming languages

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Neo4j performance with large graphs | Implement proper indexing, query optimization, and monitoring |
| Complex incremental updates | Start with simple cases, expand gradually |
| SCIP integration complexity | Begin with Go AST, add SCIP support incrementally |
| Cross-service symbol resolution | Use standardized SCIP symbol format for global uniqueness |

## Future Work

- Integration with IDE plugins
- Support for additional programming languages
- Advanced static analysis (security, performance)
- Machine learning-powered code recommendations
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated analysis

## Conclusion

This platform will provide unprecedented insight into codebase structure and relationships, enabling developers to understand and modify complex systems with confidence. By starting with a solid foundation and incrementally adding features, we can build a production-ready system while learning from real-world usage.
